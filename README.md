## sagetechcrew

This is an project I am working on to create a more centralized location for all things related to the Sage Creek Technical Theatre Crew, henceforth referred to simply as the Sage tech crew.

If you would like to help progress this project in any way, please submit a pull request to CONTRIBUTIONS.md . *(coming soon)*

Please refer to the bylaws for conduct *(coming soon)*

*This is not meant as something only for SCHS Drama productions and events (although those are included), it is meant to be for all tech crew opportunities, at Sage and other places, for Sage tech crew members.*

In memory of Marcus Montes
